<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>
            Make sure all your ingredients are ready before you start cooking. 
            Dice the vegetables, mince the garlic, and chop the onion.
             If you're using protein (like chicken or shrimp), 
             make sure it's cooked and ready to add to the fried rice.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p> 
            Heat a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. 
            Add the vegetable oil and let it heat for a moment.

        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Add the minced garlic and chopped onion to the hot oil. 
           Stir-fry for about 1-2 minutes until they become fragrant and the onion turns translucent.

        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Add the diced vegetables to the pan and stir-fry for another 2-3 minutes until they start to soften.
             If you're using cooked protein, add it to the pan at this point.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Push the cooked vegetables (and protein) to one side of the pan, 
            creating a clear space on the other side.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Pour the beaten eggs into the clear side of the pan. 
            Quickly scramble them with a spatula as they cook. 
            Once the eggs are mostly set but still slightly runny, mix them with the vegetables and protein.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Add the cooked and cooled rice to the pan. 
            Use a spatula to break up any clumps and combine the rice with the other ingredients. 
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>
            Drizzle soy sauce over the rice and continue to stir-fry, 
            mixing everything together evenly. If desired, add sesame oil for extra flavor. 
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>Once the rice is heated through and well-coated with the seasonings, 
            remove the pan from heat. Garnish with chopped green onions or cilantro, if desired.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Chinese fried rice can be served as a main dish or as a side dish alongside other Chinese dishes.

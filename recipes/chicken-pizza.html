    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Preheat your oven to the highest temperature it can go (usually around 475-500°F or 245-260°C). 
                If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven as it preheats.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>                 
                Dust your work surface with flour and roll out the pizza dough into your desired shape and thickness.
                You can make one large pizza or divide the dough to make multiple smaller ones.    
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p> Place the rolled-out dough onto a pizza stone, baking sheet, or pizza pan lined with parchment paper.
                Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges for the crust.
    
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Sprinkle about half of the shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce. 
                Then, distribute the shredded chicken, sliced red onion, sliced bell peppers, and black olives (if using) over the pizza.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Sprinkle the remaining mozzarella cheese on top of the toppings.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Carefully transfer the pizza to the preheated oven. 
                Bake for about 10-15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown, and the cheese is bubbly 
                and slightly browned.
                
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a minute or two. 
                Garnish with fresh basil leaves or parsley and, if you like it spicy, 
                sprinkle some red pepper flakes over the top. Slice the pizza and serve immediately. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <p>
            Chicken pizza is best enjoyed fresh out of the oven while the cheese is still hot and gooey.

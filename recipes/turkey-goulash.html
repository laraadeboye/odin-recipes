<h3>
    Warming turkey goulash for those chilly winter evenings.</h3>
<p>Turkey goulash is a wonderful and hearty stew that originates 
    from Hungary but has modifications and adaptations in other 
    cuisines around the world. It's typically made with tender 
    pieces of turkey (or other meats such as beef or pork) 
    cooked in a rich and flavorful tomato-based sauce, which is 
    often spiced with paprika and other seasonings.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1.5 pounds (680 grams) of turkey meat, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons sweet paprika (Hungarian paprika is traditional)</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon caraway seeds (optional)</li>
    <li>1 red bell pepper, chopped</li>
    <li>1 green bell pepper, chopped</li>
    <li>2 cups (480 ml) canned crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li>1 cup (240 ml) chicken or vegetable broth</li>
    <li>Salt and black pepper, to taste</li>
    <li>Sour cream (optional, for garnish)</li>
    <li>Chopped fresh parsley, for garnish</li>
    <li>Cooked egg noodles or rice, for serving</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>
            Heat the vegetable oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch 
            oven over medium-high heat. Add the turkey pieces and brown them 
            on all sides until they are no longer pink. This should take about 5-7 minutes. 
            Remove the turkey from the pot and set it aside.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p> In the same pot, add the chopped onions and garlic.
             Cook them over medium heat until they become soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.

        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Stir in the sweet paprika and caraway seeds (if using). 
            Cook for another minute or so to toast the spices, which will enhance their flavor.

        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Add the chopped red and green bell peppers to the pot. 
            Cook for a few minutes until they start to soften. 
            Then, pour in the canned crushed tomatoes and chicken or vegetable broth. 
            Stir well to combine.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Return the browned turkey pieces to the pot. 
            Season with salt and black pepper to taste. 
            Bring the mixture to a simmer.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let the goulash simmer for about 1 to 1.5 hours, 
            or until the turkey is tender and the flavors have melded together. 
            Stir occasionally to prevent sticking, and add more broth or water if the mixture becomes too thick.
        </p>
    </li>

            Turkey goulash is traditionally served over cooked egg noodles or rice. 
            Garnish with a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkle of chopped fresh parsley
             for a delightful finishing touch. 
        </p>
    </li>
    <p>
        Turkey goulash is a comforting and flavorful dish that's perfect for a hearty meal,
         especially during colder months. It's known for its rich, savory taste 
         and the warmth of paprika and other spices. Enjoy!
